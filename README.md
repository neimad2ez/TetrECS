## Features of TetrECS
* You have a 5x5 grid
* You must place pieces in the grid
* You score by clearing lines, horizontally or vertically
* You can rotate pieces
* You can store a single piece to come back to later
* The more lines you clear in one go, the more points you get
* Every piece that you play that clears at least one line increases your score multiplier
* As your score goes up, so does your level, and you get less time to think.
* If you fail to place a block, you lose a life.
* Lose 3 lives, and youâ€™re out of the game.
